My portfolio

This portfolio will allow you to see some of my previous work, access my resume, and also view my contact information.

Features!

- When clicking on the resume tab this will take you to a new tab that will open my resume in a PDF file.
- If you click on the images listed under the work section it will open a new tab with the previous websites that I have built so far!
- Selecting the email option or the phone option under contact me will allow you to open up your email or call me directly.
- You are able to open this link up on a cell phone or smaller page and it will move the items on the page to fit accordingly.


While working on this project I was able to challenge myself by using new fonts and centering the header and nav bar in a way that I havent been able to before!
